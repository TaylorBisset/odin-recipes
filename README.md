# Odin Recipes

## My first Odin Project. 

***Project: Recipes*** is my first project in <u>HTML</u> with multiple directories and links refering to one another. There are **ordered lists**, **unordered lists**, **bold** font, **italic** font, **underlines**, **header lines**, and more.

The assignment was to create my index.html as a home page. Then, I needed to find three recipes and make separate html files with an unordered list of ingredients followed by an ordered list of steps.

I used the target="_blank" to redirect viewers to image source websites. I split each recipe into pages on in an unordered list on the homepage (index.html) with an included image of each. 

To complete my CSS Foundations, I went back and added a styles.css file and referenced it in all pages of this repo.
